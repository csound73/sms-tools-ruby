sms-tools-ruby
==============

A version of the sms-tools (https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools) (re-written in ruby)

The original package is a sound analysis/synthesis tools for music applications written in python (with a bit of C). This package is an attempt to write a ruby gem that mimicks closely the behaviour of the original python package, though respecting the classical ruby 'convention over configuration' paradigm.
